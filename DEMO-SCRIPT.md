## 🎯 Hook: The Hackathon Problem (30 seconds)

### Opening Statement
*"Raise your hand if you've ever had a brilliant hackathon idea but struggled to turn it into a winning submission."*

### The Reality
**85% of hackathon participants fail to maximize their potential** because they:
- ❌ **Lack systematic development processes**
- ❌ **Ignore judging criteria until the last minute**
- ❌ **Struggle with professional documentation**
- ❌ **Can't effectively communicate their technical excellence**

### The Cost
- **Great ideas lose** to mediocre implementations with better presentation
- **Non-technical founders** can't compete despite having market insights
- **Experienced developers** waste time on setup instead of innovation
- **Everyone struggles** with time management and feature prioritization

*"What if there was an AI-powered assistant that could level the playing field?"*
