- **25% effort**: Documentation completion
- **25% effort**: UI polish and visualization
- **20% effort**: Final testing and submission prep

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Items
1. **Scope Creep**: Stick to Python 2→3 only
2. **Complex UI**: Simple web interface, focus on functionality
3. **AI Integration**: Use Kiro CLI effectively, don't over-engineer

### Mitigation Strategies
- Daily progress reviews with scope adjustment
- MVP-first approach with incremental improvements
- Backup plans for each major component

## Success Metrics
- **Target Score**: 90+ points
- **Demo Quality**: Compelling before/after transformations
- **Code Coverage**: >80% for core analyzers
- **Documentation**: Complete DEVLOG and README
- **Kiro Usage**: >80% development time with Kiro CLI
