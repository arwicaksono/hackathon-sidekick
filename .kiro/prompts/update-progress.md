Update project progress and calculate current score against rubric.

## Step 1: Scan Project State

### Check Application Quality
- Count implemented features vs planned
- Check for error handling, edge cases
- Review code quality (structure, comments, tests)
- Assess completeness

### Check Kiro CLI Usage
- Count custom agents in .kiro/agents/
- Count custom prompts in .kiro/prompts/
- Check for hooks in .kiro/settings/
- Review steering document quality
- Look for innovative Kiro usage

### Check Documentation
- Verify README.md completeness (setup, usage, architecture)
- Review DEVLOG.md entries (timeline, decisions, challenges)
- Check code comments and inline documentation
- Assess clarity and professionalism

### Check Innovation
- Evaluate uniqueness of approach
- Look for creative technical solutions
- Assess novelty of features

### Check Presentation
- Check if demo video exists
- Review README presentation quality

## Step 2: Calculate Scores

For each category, assign points based on current state:
- Be objective and realistic
- Compare against rubric criteria
- Document reasoning for each score

## Step 3: Identify Next Steps

Prioritize tasks by points-per-hour ratio:
1. Calculate potential points for each remaining task
2. Estimate hours required
3. Sort by ratio (highest first)
4. Consider dependencies

## Step 4: Update Progress File

Update progress/state.json with:
- Current scores
- Completed milestones
- Next prioritized steps
- Updated time tracking

## Step 5: Generate Report

Show user:
- Current total score
- Score breakdown by category
- Progress since last check
- Top 5 highest-impact next steps
- Estimated time to target score
- Risk areas (low-scoring categories)

Be specific and actionable.
