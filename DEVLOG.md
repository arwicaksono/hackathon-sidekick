- ✅ Rewrote README.md as complete product documentation

**Technical Decisions**:

#### Decision 1: Kiro CLI-Native Architecture
- **Context**: Need to build tool that maximizes Kiro CLI integration for hackathon scoring
- **Options Considered**:
  1. Standalone CLI tool with external dependencies
  2. Web-based dashboard with API integration
  3. Pure Kiro CLI framework with custom prompts and steering
- **Decision**: Pure Kiro CLI framework
- **Rationale**: 
  - Maximizes "Kiro CLI Usage" scoring category (20% of total points)
  - Leverages existing Kiro ecosystem without additional complexity
  - Provides seamless integration with AI-powered development workflow
  - Demonstrates advanced Kiro CLI usage patterns for hackathon participants
- **Impact**: Enables 85%+ Kiro CLI usage rates, directly improving hackathon scores

#### Decision 2: JSON-Based Configuration System
- **Context**: Need structured data for rubrics, progress tracking, and templates
- **Options Considered**:
  1. YAML for human readability
  2. JSON for programmatic access
  3. TOML for configuration files
- **Decision**: JSON with detailed schemas
- **Rationale**:
  - Better integration with JavaScript ecosystem
  - Easier programmatic manipulation and validation
  - Native support in most development environments
  - Clear structure for complex nested data (rubrics, evaluations)
- **Impact**: Enables precise scoring calculations and structured feedback

#### Decision 3: Template-Driven Approach
- **Context**: Need to provide guidance for multiple project types and skill levels
- **Decision**: Comprehensive template system with examples
- **Implementation**:
